# Data_Lake
In this project, We will use Spark and data lakes to build an ETL pipeline for a data lake hosted on S3. To complete the project, you will need to load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3. We will deploy this Spark process on a cluster using AWS.
